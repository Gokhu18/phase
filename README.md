============================================

PyDMS is a document management system specifically designed for the needs of major industrial projects (oil & gas, nuclear, water treatment, solar, wind facilities), where thousands of documents have to be produced, exchanged, reviewed, revised and used during construction and operation phases by multiple parties (owner/operator, contractors, vendors, partners, authorities, etc.)
