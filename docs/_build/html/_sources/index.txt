Welcome to Phase's documentation!

Introduction
------------

Phase is a document management system specifically designed for the needs of engineering and construction projects to manage the documentation of oil & gas, water treatment, nuclear, solar and wind facilities.

Phase offers the following characteristics:

* Management of document and data lists containing thousands of items
* Management of multiple metadata related to engineering, review, schedule, etc.
* Spreadsheet like filtering/search capabilities
* Document and data versioning
* Management of relationships between documents and data

Phase is intended to be used on projects where:

* Thousands of documents are generated
