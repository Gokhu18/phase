Development and test

Installation
------------

Check the `deployment` doc to see how to properly install Phase on a local
machine.

Configuration
-------------
You might need to override some local or test settings. You can create either a `local_private.py` or `test_private.py`
and add you own settings.  These files will be gitignored.
