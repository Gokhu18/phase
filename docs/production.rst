Phase in production
###################

Phase is designed to be a lightweight alternative to traditional bloated and slow
DMS. Hence a Phase instance can be run on a single virtual machine.

A single dedicated server can host several environments (pre-production,
production).

Hosting Phase on a dedicated server
-----------------------------------

If you choose to manage your own dedicated server, you can use
`OpenVZ containers <http://openvz.org>`_ to contain different Phase installations.

Follow the `OpenVZ installation instructions <http://openvz.org/Installation_on_Debian>`_.
